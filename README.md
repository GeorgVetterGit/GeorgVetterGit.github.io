## Projects

### Pokémon Clustering
![Thumbnail](/assets/clustering/BlogPost/pictures/graph%20(1).png)<br><br>
In this project I used my Typo Generator to create typos in Pokémon names. I then clustered the noisy Pokémon names with an ensemble clustering consisting of different similarity measures. The method is modularly variable and achieves a very good F1-Score of over .90. The visualisation of the clusters can be viewed below. <br><br>

### Typo Generator

To train a cluster algorithm, I needed data that was already clustered, in the form that the data points represent different spellings of a word to which they are assigned as a cluster. This allows me to check whether my cluster algorithm works well and to better optimise the hyperparameters. However, the use of a typo generator can also be interesting in many other areas. <br><br>

### t-SNE Visualization

The project investigated visualizing high-dimensional data from the MNIST dataset using the t-SNE algorithm, preserving similarity between data points. Data was loaded from MNIST, then t-SNE applied to generate coordinates for a scatterplot, with each digit class represented by a distinct color. Results demonstrated clear clustering and separation between digit classes, suggesting t-SNE's efficacy for visualizing MNIST.<br><br>

### Judge a Book by its Color
![Thumbnail](/assets/book_visualisation/pictures/title.png)<br><br>
This project analyzed the main colors of bestsellers over decades, aiming to identify dominant trends and visualize them effectively. Data from book titles, authors, and top-ranking periods were sourced from Wikipedia, while book covers were scraped from online sources. Through this analysis and visualization, valuable insights were gained into book cover design trends, providing a basis for further exploration in the field of book market analysis.<br><br>

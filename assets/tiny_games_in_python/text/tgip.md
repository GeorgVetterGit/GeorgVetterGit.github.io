### From Random to Optimal: Implementing AI Strategies in Tic Tac Toe

In this project, I developed a Tic Tac Toe game using Pygame and implemented three different AI opponents: a random AI, a Q-learning agent, and a Minimax algorithm. The goal was to explore game development, visual design, and AI strategy by training and evaluating the AIs through self-play and head-to-head matches, visualized in a Streamlit app. <br><br>

### Building a Smart Pong Opponent - From Simple Rules to Adaptive Behavior
![Thumbnail](/assets/pong/pictures/banner.png)<br><br>
This project explores a simple adaptive Pong AI that moves its paddle in response to the ballâ€™s vertical position, creating an opponent that appears intelligent despite its straightforward rules. Players can compete against the computer using arrow keys or play against another human on the same keyboard using W/S and arrow keys. The setup provides a hands-on way to experiment with agent-based behavior and adaptive systems in a fun, interactive environment.<br><br>

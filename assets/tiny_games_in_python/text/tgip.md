### From Random to Optimal: Implementing AI Strategies in Tic Tac Toe
![Thumbnail](/assets/tic_tac_toe/pictures/tic_tac_toe_banner.png)<br><br>
In this project, I developed a Tic Tac Toe game using Pygame and implemented three different AI opponents: a random AI, a Q-learning agent, and a Minimax algorithm. The goal was to explore game development, visual design, and AI strategy by training and evaluating the AIs through self-play and head-to-head matches, visualized in a Streamlit app. <br><br>

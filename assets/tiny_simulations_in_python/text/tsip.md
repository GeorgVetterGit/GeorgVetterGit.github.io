### Solving n-Queens Problem with Genetic Algorithm
![Thumbnail](/assets/nqueens/pictures/8queens_banner.png)<br><br>
This project successfully applied Genetic Algorithms to solve the N-Queens problem, demonstrating their ability to optimize complex configurations while minimizing conflicts. The accompanying visualization, developed with `pygame`, effectively illustrates the algorithm's processes and highlights its educational and practical value. <br><br>

### Bully in the Playground
![Thumbnail](/assets/bully_in_the_playground/pictures/banner.png)<br><br>
The “Bully in the Playground” model demonstrates how predator-prey dynamics and swarm behavior can emerge from just a few simple local rules. By adjusting parameters like speed, cohesion, separation, and avoidance, entirely different movement patterns appear—ranging from stable flocks to chaotic dispersal. This makes the model a powerful playground to explore emergent systems, multi-agent dynamics, and potential real-world applications.<br><br>

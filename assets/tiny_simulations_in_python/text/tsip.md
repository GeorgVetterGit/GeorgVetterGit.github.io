### Solving n-Queens Problem with Genetic Algorithm
![Thumbnail](/assets/nqueens/pictures/8queens_banner.png)<br><br>
This project successfully applied Genetic Algorithms to solve the N-Queens problem, demonstrating their ability to optimize complex configurations while minimizing conflicts. The accompanying visualization, developed with `pygame`, effectively illustrates the algorithm's processes and highlights its educational and practical value. <br><br>
